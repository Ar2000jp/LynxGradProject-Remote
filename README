LynxGradProject is the code for the graduation project of Team Lynx.
This code is released as is, without clean-up, and with all the workarounds,
    bugs, quick hacks, and whatever was needed for the deadline to be met.

Team Lynx members:-
    Shaheen Habash, Rawan Abdelqader, Raya Al-Wardat, Aya Al-Falahat,
	and Ahmad Draidi.

Project title: Car Protection and Control System

This project is a prototype made solely for the purpose of demonstrating our
    abilities as a team. Therefore, the design is, admittidly, not practical
    in a real-world setting. Designing the system for a practical use-case
    would have either over-simplified it, or made it financially impossible
    for us.

The code base contains 2000+ lines of C++ code, plus a few patches to several
    libraries used. Many optimizations and techniques were needed to make the
    hardware work within the available processing power and hardware
    capabilities, like Multi-Threading, and thread yield timing optimizations.

The hardware consists of several sensors, some of which have real-time
    requirements (Ultrasonic range sensor), plus many other parts, like
    an RTC, and 2-way ISM band RF digital radios (Si4432 based).

Some of the challenges we faced during the project were bugs in software
    libraries, bugs in hardware devices (ICs), and the limited resources
    we had at hand during development.

The project development time was ~20 days, from the beginning of design
    to delivery.

My (Ahmad Draidi) responsibilities included:
1- Designing, implementing, optimizing, troubleshooting and testing all of 
    the system's software.
2- Designing, implementing, troubleshooting and testing part of the hardware.
3- Electronic parts selection and procurement.
